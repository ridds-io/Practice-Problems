'''
Given a quadratic equation  ax2 + bx + c = 0, You have to find its roots. 
If the equation has real roots, then return floor value of each root in decreasing order, 
If the roots are imaginary return -1, the driver code will print Imaginary.

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = -2, c = 1
Output: 1 1
Explanation: Roots of equation x2-2x+1 are 1 and 1.

Input: a = 1, b = -7, c = 12
Output: 4 3
Explanation: Roots of equation x2 - 7x + 12 are 4 and 3.

Constraints:
-103 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 103

Expected Complexities

Time Complexity: O(n^(3/4))
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution:
	def quadraticRoots(self, a : int, b : int , c:int ) -> List[int]:
        D = (b * b) - (4 * a * c)
        
        if D < 0:
            # returning "-1" contains an unclosed string and an unexpected newline, which will cause a SyntaxError
            # this is because we know this function is to return a list of integers
            return [-1]
        else:
            root1 = math.floor((- b +  math.sqrt(D))/(2 * a))
            root2 = math.floor((- b -  math.sqrt(D))/(2 * a))
            
            return max(root1, root2), min(root1, root2)
